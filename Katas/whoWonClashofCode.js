// The world championship of rock paper scissors uses the best of three of three format (best of three games = one set, best of three sets = match).

// Given a sequence S of game results (1 = player 1 won, 2 = player 2 won, 0 = draw), determine who won the match.


// Example:
// Given the sequence 2 2 1 0 0 2 2, we get these sets:
// Set 1: 2 2 => Player #2 won
// Set 2: 1 0 0 2 2 => Player #2 won
// Result: Â© won two sets and therefore won the match!

// Note: A set cannot end in a draw. A set ends whenever a player has won two games.
