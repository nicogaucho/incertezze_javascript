// he deadfish is a programming language simplified to the extreme using a single memory cell (initialized at 0) and 4 functions:

// i	increments the memory cell (+1)
// d	decrement the memory cell (-1)
// s	square (^2) the value of the memory cell
// o	displays the value of the memory cell
// Example: To code the number 8, it is possible to write iiiiiiiio (8 increments and output) or iisiiiio (2 increments = 2, then squared = 4, 4 increment = 8 and output) or also iisdo (3 increments = 3, then squared = 9, 1 decrement = 8 and output)

// How to decrypt a Deadfish code?
// Deadfish is not a cipher but a programming language, so use an interpreter to launch the program and display the result.

// Example: iiiso corresponds to 3 increments i (+1+1+1=3), then a squaring s (3^2=9) and display of the result o, ie the number 9

// The program can only display numbers, but those can use a given nomenclature (ASCII code, A1Z26, etc.) to get a plain text.

// How to recognize a Deadfish code?
// Deadfish has only 4 distinct letters, by default i, s, d and o in lower case.
